<h1> Tableau Dashboard Building (practice) Project </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is actually an ongoing project, aimed for enhancing my dashboarding skill (continuously) in Tableau using a sample big dataset of a fictious superstore in the US.

<h2>Dashboards designed so far: </h2>

- <b>1. Category Dashboard - this will give clear indications about which category is performing how </b>

It is clear that "Technology" category has performed the best both in sales and profit and the rising trends are also evident for it. Although "Furniture" has a high sale traditionally, it does not produces high profit. Rather in recent times, "Office Supplies" has started tp perform well in both sales and profit.

- <b>2. Sub-Category Dashboard - now we need to know which sub-category is performing how inside each category </b>

We already know that despite high sales, "Furniture" category is generating very low profit and now going deeper, we see that "Tables" and "Bookcases" are the sub-categories that are generating losses despite decent sales amount. Then we can also know that although "Furnishings" has high profit-sales ratio, the "Chairs" sub-category contributes twice (67%) as much as "Furnishings" does (33%) towards the profit that the "Furniture" category generates in total. Similar insights can be drawn from the other two categories too.

- <b>3. Region Dashboard - after getting to know the performances of the categories and sub-categories, we now intersted to know about the region-wise performances. </b>

Here, it is clear that the WEST region is doing the best in terms of sales, profit, profit-sales ratio and even with upward trend in recent times whereas CENTRAL region, even with decent sales traditionally, cannot generate good profit.
