<h1> Tableau Dashboard Building (practice) Project </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is actually an ongoing project, aimed for enhancing my dashboarding skill (continuously) in Tableau using a sample big dataset of a fictious superstore in the US.
<br />

<h2>Dashboards designed so far: </h2>

- <b>1. Category Dashboard - this will give clear indications about which category is performing how </b>

<br />
It is clear that "Technology" category has performed the best both in sales and profit and the rising trends are also evident for it. Although "Furniture" has a high sale traditionally, it does not produces high profit. Rather in recent times, "Office Supplies" has started tp perform well in both sales and profit.


- <b>2. Sub-Category Dashboard - now we need to know which sub-category is performing how inside each category </b>

- <b>3. Region Dashboard - after getting to know the performances of the categories and sub-categories, we now intersted to know about the region-wise performances. </b>
